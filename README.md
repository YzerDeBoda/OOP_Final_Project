The Electric Bill Monitoring System is a user-friendly Java application designed to empower consumers to take control of their energy usage and reduce electricity costs


## Features

- Detailed Appliance Tracking: Input the daily usage of your household appliances (e.g., refrigerator, air conditioner, lights, etc.).
To establish a comprehensive system for tracking appliances in detail, start by creating an inventory encompassing all appliances within your home or facility. This inventory should include pertinent information such as make, model, serial number, purchase date, and warranty details. Maintain a spreadsheet to store this information, utilizing software like Microsoft Excel or specialized asset management tools for efficiency.

- Accurate Calculations: The application automatically calculates your estimated electricity consumption based on appliance wattage and hours of use, along with the current kilowatt-hour (kWh) price provided by your local electricity company.
  
- Insightful Reports: Get clear visualizations and breakdowns of your energy consumption patterns, identifying the appliances that contribute most to your bill.

- Cost-Saving Tips: Receive personalized recommendations on how to reduce your energy usage and optimize your electricity bill.
